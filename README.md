# api-demo

**A single-page web app to demonstrate and explore the usage of the API of buildup AG**

This project contains a web app contained in the `index.html` file which allows the user to load the API view for the product catalog at [https://www.buildup.ch/](builup.ch). The entry URL from which to load the API view can be constructed using a form displayed by the app. When a product is selected in the API view, the data returned from the API is displayed next to the view.

Please see the [Product Selector Documentation](https://docs.buildup.ch/api:v1:product-selector) for an explanation of the parameters which are editable in the form used to construct the entry URL.
